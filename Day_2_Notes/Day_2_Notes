General Advice
        Choose clear over clever 
        Use meaningful var names
        for simple variables use doubles ie xx vs x
        keep a script with your fav funcs to always source
        
Pseudo-code
        informal way to plan struct of code
        ignore syntax
        what vars will you need
        whats the flow cont
        
        example:
        
                set N to 100
                set R to 1.05
                initialize a vector to stor pop size over years
        
                make a for loop that goes 10 years
                in loop make new N based on previous N*R
                store each value in pop vector
        
                print N at 10 years
                plot pop vector v t
                
General layout of Modeling script
        1) Setup - load pkgs, set wd, etc 
        2) Input data, param vals, initial cond
                set N to 100
                set R to 1.05
                initialize a vector to stor pop size over years
        3) Preform calcs
                make a for loop that goes 10 years
                in loop make new N based on previous N*R
                store each value in pop vector
        4) Display results by plotting, saving, or showing
                print N at 10 years
                plot pop vector v t
         
Give your func option to decide if you should plot
        set an arg like PLOTFLAG
        and say if PLOTFLAG = 1 then plot
        else do something else?
